# LightningChart JS Audio visualization showcase

Audio visualization application created using LightningChart JS.

More information about LightningChart<sup>&#174;</sup> JS can be found from our website, https://www.arction.com/lightningchart-js/.

## Description

The audio data is extracted in realtime using [Web Audio API's](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BaseAudioContext). 

The Web Audio API has an `.createAnalyser()` method that can be used to create a new [AnalyzerNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnalyserNode).
The AnalyzerNode has methods to get time-domain data (waveform) and frequency data which is data from Fast Fourier transform on the audio signal.

The time-domain data is shown as is on the `Time Domain` chart. That same data is also pushed to the `Waveform history` chart. This chart displays the last 1 million samples of the audio input.

The last chart, `Spectrum`, is used to display three different series.

1. Spectrum of the latest samples.
2. Maximum frequencies seen.
3. Decaying frequency history.
